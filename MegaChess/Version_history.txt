This is the version that played the final, and did pretty well, placed around 10-15.

Even more cleaning and refactoring. Fixed minor bugs where the AI would send incorrect coordinates in some cases.

Even more cleaning and refactoring. So far everything still works OK.

work to do in that regard!

Function play_best_move() implemented.

Connects to server OK, but will only play Coward King until other enemiese are in range of pawns.
Unfortunately, at the moment of testing this version with the server, too few players were online and none of those were accepting
my challenges. 

Version 0.14
Function think_all_possible_common_moves() is working ok, now gives the potential negative score if a move lets a piece 
fall in a dangerous place.
Function can_be_eaten()

Version 0.13
More functions implemented.

Version 0.1
Code not very well implemented, but functional
Plays Coward King succesfully, and thatÂ´s it.
Challenges are sent only to my self, and accepted only if I am the challenger.
